# Summary

`unfold` is a Python package that allows sharing life-cycle databases 
which are derived from a database that cannot be shared. 
It relies on the exchange of data packages that contain the differences between
the databases to share and the source -- but licensed -- database. 
The data package also contains a metadata file that describes the databases, 
the user that generated them, etc. 
`unfold` allows to package and unfold any number of databases 
from a single data package, to ease the sharing and reproducibility of
life-cycle assessment databases.


# Statement of need

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) consists in the quantification of the environmental
impacts of a product or a process. It is a powerful tool to assess the
environmental performance of products and processes, and to identify
environmental hotspots. However, it is difficult to share LCA databases, 
as they are often based on a licensed data source such as ecoinvent [@Wernet:2016]. 
`unfold` allows to share databases without exposing the source
data, by sharing instead data packages that allows other users to reproduce the
LCA database (provided they have the source database registered locally).

`unfold` is initially conceived to share LCA databases that have been heavily
modified, such as those generated with the `premise` package [@Sacchi:2022], 
or those regularly produced within the field of prospective LCA (where the need to
modify extensively the source database is often required), such as those produced
by Mendoza et al. [@Mendoza:2018]

Scaling factors between the exchanges of the databases to share 
and the exchanges of the licensed database are calculated and stored in a data package, 
along with any extra datasets and a metadata file that describes 
the databases and their content (see \autoref{fig:workflow}).

`unfold` is based on the `brightway2` framework [@Mutel:2017], which means that 
it can only be used to "fold" and "unfold" databases registered in a `brightway2` project.
The data packages generated by `unfold` can be shared freely among users, as they do not 
contain any licensed data. 

`unfold` can also produce superstructure databases [@Steubing:2021], which can integrate 
several scenarios into a single database, to be further used with the LCA software
`activity-browser` [@Steubing:2020].
