# Summary

`unfold` is a Python package that allows sharing life-cycle databases 
which are derived from a data source that cannot be shared. 
It relies on the exchange of data packages that contain the differences between
the databases to share and the licensed data source. 
The data package also contains a metadata file that describes the databases, 
the user that generated them, etc. 
`unfold` allows to package and unfold any number of databases 
from a single data package, to ease the sharing and reproducibility of
life-cycle assessment databases which partly build on a license data source.


# Statement of need

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) consists in the quantification of the environmental
impacts of a product or a process. It relies on databases describing thousands of
processes, which interdependency and interactions with the greater environment 
form a large input-output matrix. However, these matrices, often modified to fit
the need of a study, are difficult to share, as they often build on a licensed data 
source, such as that of ecoinvent [@Wernet:2016]. 
`unfold` allows to share databases without exposing the data source, 
sharing instead data packages that allows other users to reproduce the
databases (provided they also have access to the licensed data source).

`unfold` is initially conceived to share LCA databases that have been heavily
modified, such as those generated with the `premise` package [@Sacchi:2022], 
or those regularly produced within the field of prospective LCA (where the need to
modify extensively the source database is often required) -- see the work of
[@Mendoza:2018] and [@Cox:2018].

Scaling factors between the exchanges of the databases to share 
and the exchanges of the licensed data source are calculated and stored in a data package, 
along with any extra datasets and a metadata file that describes 
the databases and their content (see \autoref{fig:workflow}).

`unfold` is based on the `brightway2` framework [@Mutel:2017], which means that 
it can only be used to "fold" and "unfold" databases registered in a `brightway2` project.
The data packages generated by `unfold` can be shared freely among users, as they do not 
contain any data under restrictive license. 

`unfold` can also produce superstructure databases [@Steubing:2021], which can integrate 
several scenarios into a single `brightway2` database, to be further used with the LCA 
software `activity-browser` [@Steubing:2020].
